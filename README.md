# ETL - Extract, Transfom, Load

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a clean pipeline of data to be imported to an SQL database for use in a hackathon. The data comes in the format of a json file from Wikipedia and two CSVs from Kaggle. The project looks at removing unneeded data and cleaning up inconsistencies to keep only the information needed in a consistent and easily read format. After cleaning, the data is loaded to a PostgresSQL database.
